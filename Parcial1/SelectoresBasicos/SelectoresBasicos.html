        <p>First fact: your PC computer has deep inside its guts an 8088 processor, no
            matter how advanced it is or how many gigahertz it runs at.</p>
        <p class="important">Second fact: your 8088 processor is an idiot. It takes its instructions
            from boxes (known as memory), reads them and does the indicated
            operation, then (if the instruction doesn't tell otherwise) it will advance to
            next box and so on, until the end.</p>
        <p>The instructions in fact are bytes read from RAM or ROM memory
            (the basic system that boots your machine to run Windows or Linux). Some
            instructions take 1 byte, others take 2 bytes, and so on. An instruction to
           put a data value inside an address can take 6 bytes.</p>
